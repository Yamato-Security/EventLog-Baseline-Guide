## Features

### Windows Event Log Audit Settings Baseline Guide Comparison
Compare audit settings across multiple authoritative sources:
- **Windows Default**: Microsoft's default configuration
- **YamatoSecurity**: Community-driven security configurations
- **Australian Signals Directorate**: Government security recommendations
- **Microsoft Server**: Server-specific recommendations
- **Microsoft Client**: Client-specific recommendations

### Key Metrics
- **Audit Settings Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of recommended vs default settings
- **Log File Size Recommendations**: Optimal log retention settings
- **Sigma Rule Statistics**: Impact analysis on detection rule effectiveness
- **Service and Category Breakdown**: Granular analysis by Windows services and categories

## Color-Coded Interface

The application uses an intuitive color-coding system:
- **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow**: Changes required from default settings
- **ðŸŸ¢ Pale Green**: Default settings are acceptable
- **âšª Light Gray**: No auditing required or no recommendations available

## Key Insights

The tool helps answer critical questions:
- Which audit settings need to be changed from defaults?
